# Seat Assignment

This is an interactive web application to map the seats of a plane.

The seat map is dynamically generated by fetching the dummy data from [https://s3.amazonaws.com/frontend-candidate-homework.lola.co/seats.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/frontend-candidate-homework.lola.co/seats.json).
(A copy is also included in the `/assets/data/` directory).<br/>
